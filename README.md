# PyHarmonic
A module for working with the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator. \n
The Quantum Harmonic Oscillator is arguably the most important physical system, ever.
Any smooth potential around a stability point can be approximated as a harmonic potential.
It is also one of the few quantum-mechanical systems for which an exact, analytical solution is known.
